UART Debugging Notes
====================

Problem: Only 8 bits work at a time via UART

Observations:
1. With original byte order: uart_buffer[0] | (uart_buffer[1] << 8)
   - Bits 8-13 work (MINUS, PLUS, stick clicks, HOME, CAPTURE)
   - Bits 0-7 don't work

2. With swapped byte order: uart_buffer[1] | (uart_buffer[0] << 8)
   - Bits 0-7 work (B, A, Y, X, L, R, ZL, ZR)
   - Bits 8-15 don't work

3. TEST_MODE (no UART) works perfectly with all buttons

Hypothesis:
- Python sends: struct.pack('<H', buttons) = [low_byte, high_byte]
- UART buffer receives bytes sequentially
- Only ONE of the two bytes is being received properly

Possible causes:
1. Buffer synchronization - we start reading mid-packet
2. UART baud rate mismatch
3. UART FIFO settings
4. Packet framing - no header/footer to sync on

Solution needed:
- Add packet synchronization (header byte)
- Or verify both bytes are being received
- Or add debug output to see what's in uart_buffer[0] and uart_buffer[1]
